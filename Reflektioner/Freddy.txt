I began by reading to undersaand the teacher's vision for the project. 
Once I had a clear grasp, I created a rough private copy before our firsst meting. 
During that meeting, we recogniced the three main components: the KitchenView, the BurgerOrderer, 
and the database (along with the server). This will helped us be more efectiv and gain a
good basis for the project

We used our git hub accounts and created a project together. Since I already had one i will just continue 
using it. Afterward, we split up to start working on the project. The second meeting 
served more as a check-in to see how everyone was working and to se were the project was. We didn’t impose any boundaries 
on tasks, which made us be able to help one another more whenever someone would have something challenging. 
This cllaborative construct made the proceses better for the group. 

And then the thirde meeting came, as we were nearing the finish line of the site, 
which relived the entire gorup. By that point, we were just three weeks away form the deadlin that was imposed on us by the teacher. 
Our left over tasks where bug testing and implimentation of various features, 
such as the orderCart. I focused on the admin side and ironing out most of the buggs there while also working on the
database. And what data we needed.

Debugging went well, and allmost everything worked as intended,  
We conducted tests(manually) while also setting up som rudementary tests, during which I began
learn about pytest. This Python library was helpful for testing. We also tried
to implement Docker, which became the most
challenging part of the project. Despite the difficulties, we achieved a
working build in Docker.

next we have Docker Compose, which was impossible given
our curent setup.(we had to rewrite everything almost) After a long night and some frtration, 
we managed to create functional website using Docker Compose, complete with a database. 
With that, we can officially say that we’ve finnished this project.

As for my part, I was supposed to create Python tests, but due to time constraints, 
I wasn’t able to finish them at all.
