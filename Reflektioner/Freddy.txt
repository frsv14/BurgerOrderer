I started by reading to understand the teacher's vision for the project. 
Once I had a clear grasp, I created a rough private copy before our first meeting. 
During that meeting, we identified the three main components: the KitchenView, the BurgerOrderer, 
and the database (along with the server). This helped us plan more effectively and gain a
solid understanding of the project.

We also set up our GitHub accounts in that first meeting. Since I already had one, I 
continued using it. Afterward, we split up to start working on the project. The second meeting 
served as a check-in to see how everyone was progressing. We didn’t impose strict boundaries 
on tasks, allowing us to support one another whenever someone faced time constraints or challenges. 
This collaborative approach made the process smoother for the team.

The third meeting came a bit later, as we were nearing completion of the site, 
which relieved the entire team. By that point, we were just three weeks away from the deadline. 
Our remaining tasks involved thorough bug testing and implementing various features, 
such as the order cart. I focused on improving the admin side while also working on optimizing the
database.

Debugging went well, and nearly everything was functioning as expected. 
We conducted manual tests while also setting up automated tests, during which I began
learning about pytest. This Python library proved helpful for testing our code. However,
we also attempted to implement Docker at this stage, which became the most
challenging aspect of the project. Despite the difficulties, we ultimately achieved a
reliable build in Docker.

Next came the introduction of Docker Compose, which initially seemed almost impossible given
our current setup. After a long night of work and some frustration, 
we managed to create a semi-functional website using Docker Compose, complete with a database. 
With that, we can officially say that we’ve completed this project.

As for my part, I was supposed to create improved Python tests, but due to time constraints, 
I wasn’t able to finish them.
